Best of the 90s?  Maybe.  One of the best?  Definately.  It's just one of those albums jam packed with tight rock that anybody who is into anything but disny music needs to have in their collection.  If Definately Maybe was about the dream of becomming a "rockNroll star," this album is the sequal where the dream comes true  
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Songs:
                        &lt;br /&gt;1. Hello- nothing has said "hello" better than this song
                        &lt;br /&gt;2. Roll With It-exactly.  just listen to it.  This one really has a magic to it.
                        &lt;br /&gt;3. Wonderwall-sure it's cliche, and it's been remade more times than I'd like to admit.  Not even their best song.  Yet, this is one of my favorite rock anthems.
                        &lt;br /&gt;4.Don't look back in anger-Alway been a favorite Oasis song.  Nod to "Let It Be." (but NOT a ripoff)
                        &lt;br /&gt;5. Hey Now-don't you dare turn the cd off
                        &lt;br /&gt;6.Okay, MAYBE could have lived without the swamp song clip
                        &lt;br /&gt;7.Some Might Say-that this is a great song and a great cd!
                        &lt;br /&gt;8. Cast No Shadow-Deep, philosphical, accoustic, love this song
                        &lt;br /&gt;9.She's Electric-Catchiest one of the cd, this makes me grin
                        &lt;br /&gt;10.Title Track-This has the same rock magic that is contained in "Roll W/ It." Words can't describe.
                        &lt;br /&gt;11. See #6
                        &lt;br /&gt;12.Champagne Supernova-basically what we're saying here is, "f*** off, I'm gonna be famous, try and stop me!"
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Stop reading reviews.  Stop listening to those who say they are Beatles ripoffs and or those who make fun of how much the gallaghers hate each other.  Just buy it, or else evil pterridacyles will hijack your pt cruiser, and God won't love you anymore.

Defitinatly Maybe was a true rock album, the loudest sound from England since " Never Mind The Bullocks" and " Be Here Now" was awesome as well in it's own right. This album was when Noel knew that he was the best songwriter in the world. He could do know wrong. They no longer wanted to be rock and roll stars, they were. "Wonderwall"
                        &lt;br /&gt;"Champagne Supernova" " Morning Glory" " Roll With It" are as good as any songs you will ever here. I have to say my favorite song is " Some Might Say" . Noel at this time was the king of rock. If you are lucky enough to buy the record, you will here an artifact "Bonehead's Bank Holiday" which is hidden. It was was sad to see Bonehead and Guigsy leave during the SOTSOG 
                        &lt;br /&gt;sessions and unfortunately Oasis has never been the same, although Don't Believe The Truth is showing that Noel, Liam as well as Bell, Archer are capable of making great music still. They recorded this album in the summer of 95 during the most exciting period in England's history since the sixties when the Beatles and Stones were rulers. Oasis is still my favorite band of all time. This album as well as "Definately Maybe" and "Be Here Now" only prove my point.

Many people dont like Oasis becuase the claim to better than the beatles..... well they are. I base music on the way it sounds and the way it makes me feel not what the lyrics are. Ill admit the beatles had much better lyrics than Oasis but Oasis just plain old sounds better than the beatles. I know many people are going to disagree and take offense to me saying that Oasis are better than the Beatles but its my opinion. Oasis just sounds great and this CD proves it. Rock n Roll at its finest. I didnt think so at first but Oasis has made me believe that they are the best bnad in the world. This is an amazing album and is filled with great songs. I especially love wonderwall in my opinion it is the best song ever written. Morning Glory is also amazing and so is champagne supernova. This song is packed with great tunes. Like I said earlier i base music on sound and the way it makes me feel. This album has an unbeatable sound and makes me feel great. Every time i hear Oasis i jump up and sing along because their sound gets in your head and reverberates through your body. It makes you feel good and at peace with the world
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;I tried listening to the beatles but they are painful to listen too. their music sounds forced and painful but Oasis has a swagger that the Beatles cant touch. I know this will upset die hard beatles fans but its my opinion. Many people dont realize how good Oasis are because they hate them for claiming to be better than the beatles and have a stereotype against them and refuse to listen to them. Give them a chance and listen and you will fall in love with them like I have.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Now back to the album; its Amazing. Probably the best album ever (maybe Oasis previous album Definitely maybe holds that honor)The three best songs on the album are: Wonderwall, Champagne Supernova, and Morning Glory. Followed by Some might Say and the soft and beautiful Dont look backi in anger. There are other classics such as Hey now, shes electric and cast no shadow.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Buy this album its sounds amazing and it makes you feel great. Sorry if I offended any Beatles fans but give this album a chance.... you wont regret it
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Long live Oasis

If you're looking for the new Beatles, it's probably never gonna happen. Rock and roll is about character and swagger. Liam and Noel Gallagher were young kids with big mouths who shot off about everyone and everything. 
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;As far as Radiohead and My Bloody Valentine, comparing them to Oasis is like comparing apples and spaceships; not the same ballpark, not even the same sport. All three bands are genius in their own ways. 
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Oh, and about asking Radiohead what they think of Oasis?
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;"We felt there was nothing left for anyone else after this single dropped. Rock and roll had been perfected. It was either change genres or find new jobs."
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Thom Yorke on music after "Wonderwall."
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, this is an amazing album, almost as good as Oasis' debut "Definitely Maybe."

                    <Source>Amazon.com</Source><Content>This big rock candy mountain of an album justifies some if by no means all of the poses and pretentious statements made by Manchester's natural-born rock &amp; roll deities. A dramatic attempt to rekindle the flames of the original British Invasion, &lt;I&gt;Morning Glory&lt;/I&gt; rolls 30 years of Britpop tradition into one irresistible (if achingly self-conscious) whole. "Wonderwall" can be read as a Beatles tribute, "Don't Look Back in Anger" feels like a Mott The Hoople anthem and "She's Electric" and "Morning Glory" are chewy pop confections.  &lt;i&gt;--Jeff Bateman&lt;/i&gt; </Content>

                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Despite the years that have passed, this is one of those albums that is always good to listen to, and as such, it has so far stood the test of time.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;When Oasis burst onto the UK music scene back in the 90s I was 17, just finishing high school, and there was genuine excitement among us 'kids' about this band.  No other band had generated such excitement in our lifetimes, and no band has done so since.  When a new Oasis single was about to be released, it was all everyone was talking about.  And, once it had been released, everyone was talking about how great it was, and which was their favourite 'B side' track.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;I love this album.  It was the soundtrack to my 'Golden Years' - those great days in your late teens when everything is good in the world, and all that matters is going out (or hanging out) with your mates.  What better way to enjoy those days than by listening to 'Supersonic' or 'Rock'n'Roll Star' while you do so?
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Oasis' later offerings I considered disappointing.  But that's understandable, when they produced a debut like this.  How do you follow it up?  You can't.  In some ways I wish Oasis had crashed and burned after this storming debut.  It would have been a fitting way to have ended things - bursting onto the scene, showing everyone how a record should be made, doing the rock'n'roll thing, then bursting into flames and disappearing into the place of legends.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;If you don't already own this album, buy it now.  Open a beer, spark up a cigarette, and PLAY IT LOUD.

I love every single song that Oasis has recorded, it just seems to be the band that fits me best. Even twelve years after its release, Oasis's debut album Definitely Maybe still sounds magnificent. Many consider this album to be the finest debut album of all time, while personally I believe it to be the finest album of all time.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Let me put my love for Oasis to good use in describing you the beauty of Definitely Maybe, my favorite Oasis album and my favorite album ever.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;1: "Rock 'n' Roll Star" This is my favorite Oasis song. From the second I heard it I was hooked. Five minutes and twenty three seconds of pure joy.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;2: "Shakermaker" Sounds like a drug-induced vision of magnificence. Trippy, but upbeat and hard rocking.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;3: "Live Forever" Absolutely beautiful. The lyrics flow majestically. Must be heard to be believed.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;4: "Up In The Sky" The music is upbeat and happy, but the lyrics are sad. Makes you happy but sad at the same time, an interesting tune.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;5: "Columbia" Pure Oasis. Gritty and harsh, the lyrics are not meant to be understood, just heard. A great song.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;6: "Supersonic" Oasis's first single leaves one stunned. Goes in and out from the "Brit grit" Oasis to the bittersweet Oasis in the A and B parts of the song. Sad but graceful.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;7: "Bring It On Down" This song is an experience. Whenever I hear this song, my body seems to collect energy. The louder the better. The lyrics sound like an insult, and the music sounds like a force to be felt. This is pure.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;8: "Cigarettes &amp; Alcohol" This song is fun to listen to. Not exactly beautiful, but nicely sour. Tastes like a British pub.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;9: "Digsy's Dinner" A sad song. Sounds harsher, but harsh is what most of definitely maybe is. Nice little tune.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;10: "Slide Away" A beautiful song, bittersweet but a nice ride. Takes me to a different place.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;11: "Married With Children" One of the only really "soft" songs here. Purely acoustic and magnificent.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Overall, its a beautiful album. I may have seemed to glorify the album, but the album really is glorious after all.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;This is one album that should be in every music lover's collection. Absolutely beautiful.

Combining a pummeling guitar surge with the melodicism of the Beatles and the psychedelic sensibilities of the Stone Roses, "Definitely Maybe" still sounds like a world-beater. From Britpop touchstone "Shakermaker" to riff monster "Supersonic" to the melancholy yet anthemic "Slide Away," every track is an era-defining classic. Simply put, this is one of the landmark British debut albums of all time.</Content>

It's my #1.</Summary><Content>I was born in 1982 and Oasis is, in my opinion, the best band of my generation. Nirvana was inventive and genre-defining, and Green Day is cool if you're into 16 year old girl in high school punk pop, but Oasis is actually a Rock and Roll band. 
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;I don't dig the Creed, Nickelback, Staind nonsense. I don't like rap. I don't watch American Idol. I hate country. What can a poor boy do? Find some real rock and roll.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;So if you're giving this album a negative review, you've either found a stash of outstanding albums that have come out in the past 12 years that I sure haven't heard, or you're still spinning the same stuff you were 20 years ago.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;There's a reason the people of the UK adore this album; it's amazing. The guitar work is fabulous, Liam's singing is raunchy and rock and roll. The drum work is average at best, but so was Ringo's, since everyone is hung up on the Beatle comparisons. 
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Yes, this album was ranked over Sgt. Peppers and Revolver in the NME poll, which is a very bold statement, considering the importance of those albums. Oh well, thats just the opinion of a couple million people. 
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;I'm just glad there's people out there still listening to The Monkees. And I'm glad there's people out there bashing this album. I guess that's the reason I like Oasis and this album so much.

                    <Source>Amazon.com</Source><Content>With the swaggering chords of the opening "Rock'N'Roll Star," Oasis announced that big, brash Brit rock was here to stay--at least for a few years. They wore their rock &amp; roll with an angry young sneer, a Mancunian petulance wedded to a vision of cathartic release. Their supersonic two-guitar attack took them "Up in the Sky," where they would "Live Forever" or burn out in a blaze of alcoholic glory. Noel Gallagher's songs weren't subtle--or shy of overt plagiarism--but, spat out in the Lennonesque snarl of little brother Liam, they took on a venomous power that had millions of young Brits taking them at their own arrogant word. In the U.S., meanwhile, the response was more Maybe than Definitely.  &lt;i&gt;--Barney Hoskyns&lt;/i&gt; </Content>

They had been a cocky, over-the-top, excessive group before, but on "Be Here Now" they really cranked up the noise and bravado.  Just look at the length of the songs.  "My Big Mouth" (my personal favorite track) seems like a simple ditty compared to the colossal songs that make up the remainder of the album.  "All Around the World" clocks in at a modest 9 minutes, and then reprises at the end of the disc.  "D'ya Know What I Mean" begins the album with a bombastic roar that never really relents.  Yet, this is exactly the road that Oasis was headed in from the very beginning.  They were always about being the biggest, about being the best to the point of excess.  This album is the culmination of the lifestyle they had been enjoying up til '97.  That's exactly what makes this album so great.  It's carefree yet bombastic.  It's fun but overwhelming.  It's both frustrating and engaging.  There is no other Oasis album like it, for better or for worse.  All of the criticisms mean nothing when you hear a song as wonderful as "Stand By Me" or "Magic Pie."  Oasis were nothing if not entertaining (something that can't be said of their most recent efforts).  "Be Here Now" is both a celebration of and a funeral for Britpop.  Give it another chance.  I'm sure you'll like it.</Content>

I'm a massive fan of Oasis - they're my favourite band of all time. Definitley Maybe is the best debut album ever, What's the Story Morning Glory before this album was the greatest album of all time. How can you follow up an album with such bonafide masterpieces such as Wonderwall, Don't Look Back In Anger, Some Might Say, Morning Glory and Champagne Supernova? 
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Be Here Now does it, does it with aplomb, with a lot of noise, arrogance and catchiness. Critics only panned this album because they compared it to the previous two Oasis releases. They still called it a great album, but nowhere near as good as what has become expected of Oasis. Which is absolute BS. 
                        &lt;br /&gt;Yes it's loud. Yes it's long. But it's rock. Noel Gallagher has refused to play anything from BHN since the world tour of 1997/98 and it's a damn shame. He has stated time and time again he rushed the third album and that it was recorded under a haze of cocaine and alcohol.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;D'You Know What I Mean? is an anthem for the ages, and the first single of the album. It's a statement that yes, we are the biggest band in the f*&amp;^%ng world and they know it. My Big Mouth continues the rock until we get to the Noel sung Magic Pie, and the Liam driven Stand By Me. Now we get really into the rock n roll.
                        &lt;br /&gt;I hope, I think, I know &amp; The Girl in the Dirty Shirt are pop/rock driven melodies that push the tempo of the album up, where My Big Mouth left off. Then we get in the bluesy/rock Fade In Out.
                        &lt;br /&gt;Don't Go Away is a tear jerking ballad that takes the tempo down a nothc before we get into the self titled song, which is BHN's best. The screaming toward the end of this track by Liam, mark as the best moment in any one Oasis song i can recall. He really goes hell for leather.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;All Around The World and It's Getting Better Man are absolute gung ho, loud, rock, gangbusters which typlify the album. Loud, long, and f^%$#ing aggressive, man.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Obviously if you're reading this review you are thinking about buying it. The fact that you don't already have it is mindboggling, but there is time to be made up. Go out and buy the bloody thing now.
                        &lt;br /&gt;

People either embrace it or pass it off as an overproduced, overblown waste of their time. However, I can say that this is my favorite Oasis album. Why? That's a very good question...maybe because Be Here Now was my introduction to Oasis, and I could tell that this band had a lot to offer, even through the drug-addled, overproduced songs that seemed to last forever. Each one is very catchy and has an overall feel-good quality to it, two characteristics of most Oasis songs. 
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;It's no use comparing Be Here Now to Morning Glory or Def. Maybe, because it's in a whole other ballpark. This is Oasis going totally over the top and pushing their music to the limit. No doubt that all the coke helped with that. It's my firm belief that Morning Glory and Def. Maybe were and still are great albums in their own rights. Be Here Now is just something else, you either love it or hate it. It has it's own little Oasis category. I can see why it never really lived up to its two famous predecessors.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;There are some valid complaints about this album, though. One, it is very very overproduced, filled to the top with snarling buzzing guitars and who knows what else. Unfortunately, this makes it hard to listen to with earphones for very long. Two, the songs are astonishingly long at times. All Around the World, while an excellent song, clocks in at around 9:20. I believe that the shortest song is I Hope, I Think, I Know, coming in at 4:23. So you know you're in for a long, wild ride. 
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;However, only Oasis could pull this off - making ridiculously long songs that are almost ear-numbing to listen to - and every minute is made enjoyable. All the arrogance, coke, and swagger in these songs is perhaps what makes it so appealing to some people. And of course, there's that small note on the upper left-hand corner of pages 7 and 8 in the booklet that proclaims : "The Beatles are quite good, but Oasis is much better."
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;And so a resounding yes to all of these: overproduced, arrogant, drug-induced, staggering, amazing, excellent. I don't care about the negative things, though, because that's what makes Be Here Now a sucess in its own right. 
                        &lt;br /&gt;

Though many songs are actually quite good ( a few very good ), the production makes it hard to listen to the album for very long. Most tracks are burdened down by numerous over-dubs of distorted guitars, and the songs generally go on for way too long.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Fortunately there are moments of pleasure too.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;"Don't Go Away" is an Oasis ballad like when they are best; a wonder this fine song was not released as a single. 
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;"Stand By Me" is almost as good, but it suffers a bit from going on for too long.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;"All Around the World" is the perfect closing track. It has a fine acoustic intro and an extremely catchy chorus. Though it is the longest track on the album it really doesn't feel like it. I would have cut off 2-3 minutes, though.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;The Beatles-inspired "Girl in the Dirty Shirt" is also quite good.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;The opening track, and the first single, "Do You Know What I Mean" may have sounded right in 1997, but the song has not aged very well, and it's more or less a drag listen though this overloaded and longwinded recording.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Most of the rockers are not up the standards of early Oasis.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;At a certain point Noel said something about remixing the album; that would really be interesting. I'm sure a much better album could come of that.

As much as I love Oasis, as much as I wanted Be Here Now to be as good if not better than their first two albums, I'll be the first to criticize England's greatest 90's alt band for the mass inconsistency here.  Indeed, Be Here Now seems thrown together for the sake of pleasing a salivating British public, who, like me, wanted more Morning Glory?.  Instead, we received a really fascinating mix of some quality tracks and absolute garbage, throw-away, Morning Glory? B-sides.  On the bright side, the arrogant yet infatuating `D'You No What I Mean' and the `Hey Jude' imitator and AT&amp;T's favorite `All Around the World' rank among the best songs of Oasis career.  We also have `My Big Mouth,' a splendid hard-rocker, and the big time `Don't Go Away,' a dazzling ballad that's right there with `Cast No Shadow' and `Don't Look Back in Anger.'  These four tracks alone morph Be Here Now from a collection of hyped filler into a worthy listen, but there's very little after the latter.  `It's Getting Better (Man!!)' and `I Hope, I Think, I Know' are okay, but the likes of `Magic Pie, Fade In-Out,' and the title track all need to burn in hell for their sins against quality Oasis.  I agree with whoever first said that if Oasis had thrown `Acquiesce' and `Fade Away' from The Masterplan on this A-side release and likewise shave of the worthless filler, Be Here Now would be as much of a classic as its predecessors.  Not even on the same level as Definitely Maybe or (WTS) MG?, but enough value for 3.5 stars all the same.  Not bad for arguably their weakest release to date.  </Content>

Oasis are one of the most underrated bands here in america...it seems as though true rock 'n roll tends to be ignored by most here in the states. it's a shame, really. 'Don't Believe The Truth' is an excellent album. i'm not going to say that it's Oasis back in form...because to me, they're just as great as they've always been. it's obvious that this album was influenced by the '60s...but is that bad? i wouldn't say so. we've known from the beginning that they idolized The Beatles. i think that's why i love Oasis, though...The Beatles are my all-time favorite band, and Oasis are my favorite band from my generation...Oasis are the only band that even comes close to resembling The Beatles. for me, that's a great thing. with songs like "love like a bomb", "the importance of being idle" and "let there be love", you can't help but think it's great. liam &amp; noel gallagher's voices are just as great as they've ever been, as well on this album...the duet "let there be love" is...it's hard to describe. for those who've heard "acquiesce", you'll know what i mean...whether you think "let there be love" is better, is entirely up to you. personally, i have my days when i think it is, then there are days when i don't...but, nonetheless, i love the song! liam's songs "love like a bomb" &amp; "guess god thinks i'm abel" were favorites of mine right away...his songwriting has really become impressive over the years. if you have the opportunity, check out the song "pass me down the wine" which is a b-side on the "the importance of being idle" single. it's one of liam's best songs to date. if you're just starting to listen to Oasis, well, this is a great album to start with...i can't say anything bad about it. if you've been an Oasis fan from the start, you're bound to love it.

"Heathen Chemistry", with the exception of "Stop crying your heart out" was a bad album, and both "the masterplan" and "Standing on the shoulders of giants" didn't do anything for me. I was really hoping that this record would be their comeback, but sadly i was disappointed yet again. To be fair, the album is the best thing the band has put out since "Be Here Now" (which featured the fabulous "Stand by me") and there are some good songs here. "Mucky fingers" is the catchiest thing the band has done in a long time, and "Lyla" is an enjoyable, if unoriginal single, but most of the album is simply boring. "love like a bomb", "the meaning of soul", "part of the queue", and "a bell will ring" are all forgettable trite, and the good moments such as the opener "Turn up the sun" are over far too quickly.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;"The importance of being idle" and "guess god thinks im abel" are decent songs, but the truth is that the old oasis sound is gone. It's been gone since "Be here now", and the spark the band had throughout the entire "Morning glory" album is nowhere to be seen. It really feels like the band is only going through the motions, and if thats true then maybe its time Oasis hung it up for good. I may or may not be right in thinking that, and the brilliant closer "Let there be love" makes me think that the band may still have it in them. The song has Liam and Noel sharing the mic, and the result is the best thing oasis has done in years.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;In the end the album is far better than the bands last three releases, but if you're short on cash i would recommend leaving this album on the shelf and perhaps downloading the aforementioned highlights. Hardcore Oasis fans should probably have this, but if you're hoping for the next "Morning glory" you will surely be disappointed.

I know that sounds crazy, but during the peak of their U.S. popularity in the 90s, I was more into grunge and paid little attention to "BritPop." I can tell you that from the day I put this in my CD player, it did not come out for three weeks. I actually heard the song "Lyla" on my FIFA soccer game, and that's the reason I got the album. I can definitely hear the Beatles' influence on their sound, specifically the guitar on "Lyla" (reminds me of "Getting Better") and the drums on "A Bell Will Ring" (reminds of "Tomorrow Never Knows"). And since I am new to the Oasis thing, can somebody explain to me what "BritPop" is supposed to mean? This isn't what I would call pop -- this is guitar-driven rock. This is the best album I've bought since the "Garden State" soundtrack more than a year ago. If the Beatles were together today, they'd sound like Oasis. I can't give this album a higher compliment than that.</Content>

Even if Oasis take their sound farther than they used to do in thier biggest success What's the Story, it still sounds very "Oasis".
                        &lt;br /&gt;The best tracks are: Lyla, A Bell Will Ring and Let There Be Love.
                        &lt;br /&gt;If you were wishing for a good material by the Gallagher brothers, you must purchase this album

                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;I always allow some room for nostalgia, as that's a big part of Oasis (for me).  My favorite tracks on this album are The Importance Of Being Idle and Part Of The Queue.  'Part of the Queue' is definately one of my favorite Oasis tracks to date, it's very different from their normal, and I wish they would go deeper in this direction.  All in all, every track on this album is solid and worth a listen to.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind I don't listen to the radio and got this as a promo from the store I work at.

                    <Source>Amazon.com</Source><Content>Oasis albums have always prompted flashbacks--Was that a Beatles melody? Is that chorus on loan from T. Rex? Wait, wasn't that a Crowded House song once? But the mouthy British group's latest really sounds like a pop artifact. Both in production and execution, &lt;i&gt;Don't Believe The Truth&lt;/i&gt; feels like an album better suited to 1965 than 2005. From the tambourines and jangling guitars that chime in opening track "Turn Up To The Sun" to the tinny pre-hippie philosophizing of "Keep The Dream Alive," it's an album that thinks the way forward is by looking back. First single "Lyla" borrows its opening swagger from the Rolling Stones' "Street Fighting Man," while "The Meaning of Soul" lifts the Small Faces' mod jitters wholesale. But hack through the clichéd lyrics and worn riffs and the most important element on the follow up to 2002's &lt;i&gt;Heathen Chemistry&lt;/i&gt; remains distinctly Oasis' own: Attitude. And in such wonderful abundance, "No one could break us/ No one could take us," they sing. &lt;i&gt;--Aidin Vaziri&lt;/i&gt;</Content>

There isn't an Oasis song I don't like. So I'm going to guide you throughout the entire album and give you my overall opinion of the album.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;The Masterplan is a collection of Oasis B-sides from singles covering their first three albums (Definitely Maybe, (What's The Story) Morning Glory, and Be Here Now). The featured tracks and the track listing were decided from an online poll of Oasis fans in 1998.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;First up: "Acquiesce" This is probably the most famous Oasis b-side out there and often played live. This song is fantastic, the combined vocal solos of both Liam and Noel Gallagher make this song magnificent. Noel's solo seems to sound better than Liam's, but nevertheless a beautiful song.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Track Two: "Underneath The Sky" Liam Gallagher sings. It sounds good, not as strong as "Acquiesce" but an upbeat and nice tune.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Track Three: "Talk Tonight" Noel with a beautiful guitar based song. This is something you would hear a street performer sing, the lyrics are sad, but the tune is relaxing. Great song.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Track Four: "Going Nowhere" Noel sings once again, and the song is another sad one, but there is a mix of brass and string to lighten it up. A nice soft listen.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Track Five: "Fade Away" After the first few chords you know this is from the Definitely Maybe era. Hard, pure rock from Oasis with a good amount of "Shoegazer" influence. Never fails to slam a good dose of energy into me.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Track Six: "The Swamp Song" If you liked the untitled filler tracks on Morning Glory and wanted the whole song, that's exactly what "The Swamp Song" is. It was originally a warm up song for recording sessions, and you can tell why. Nice hard guitar with even a mix of harmonica in it all. Fantastic little tune.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Track Seven: "Listen Up" My personal favorite song of the album. It plays hard but feels soft. Bittersweet and beautiful. Noel's voice shines and the lyrics flow magnificently. This song should have been a single instead of a b-side. A hidden gem.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Track Eight: "I Am The Walrus (Live)" First of all, this song was not played live. It was recorded during a soundcheck with the audience noises later added in. Nevertheless an entertaining song, and a faster paced and harder rocking song than the original. Seems to get repetitive at the end though, but that might have been why Oasis sometimes played this song last at concerts in their early days.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Track Nine: "Rockin' Chair" Supposedly written by Noel Gallagher back in 1990, this song makes an interesting b-side. Nice acoustic guitar solos and the organ mixes in well. A very well written song for it being one of Noel's firsts.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Track Ten: "Half The World Away" A great song and another bittersweet one. Noel sings very well, while the electic guitar and organ mix in softly and nicely.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Track Eleven: "(It's Good) To Be Free" Another hard rocker that sounds like "Shoegazer" rock as opposed to Britpop. The lyrics could use a bit of support, but I nevertheless enjoy it. There is a bit of nice organ that sounds like an electric guitar.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Track Twelve: "Stay Young" Another famous b-side, featured in the film "The Faculty". The lyrics sound like a teen revolution, "Stay young and invincible", but the melody is upbeat and happy. Nice song.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Track Thirteen: "Headshrinker" My second favorite song of the album. Sounds like rock overcooked to a crisp. This is as hard and pure as Oasis gets. Fantastic song.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Track Fourteen: "The Masterplan" The track that the album was named after makes a nice finish for the album. Strings and brass mixed in well in a bittersweet and smooth song. Don't miss the guitar solo (a reversed recording of a solo). Leaves you with a great aftertaste for the entire album.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Now, the songs that should have been here but didn't make the cut. Sadly, my favorite Oasis b-side (and quite a popular one as well), "Sad Song", is missing. In fact, they should have added all of the Definitely Maybe-era b-sides, because they were by far the best. "Alive", "Take Me Away", "D'yer Wanna Be a Spaceman", and "Cloudburst" are some of the best Oasis b-sides but sadly arent on The Masterplan. Instead there was more focus on Morning Glory-era b-sides. "Angel Child" was another b-side from the Be Here Now-era that I very much enjoy but just wasn't there.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great album. I highly reccomend it to anybody who just loves music. The album is one of my favorites because it encompasses the sound of Oasis through three different albums and most songs are beautifully bittersweet. I also enjoyed hearing Noel's voice often, which is nice considering Liam sings most of the singles. At time of writing there are supposedly plans for a sequel to "The Masterplan" covering Oasis b-sides from their next three albums, and it will be interesting to see what makes that grade.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;This is indeed a fantastic collection of Oasis b-sides.

So prolific was he that the singles from that brief period contained a further 20 new songs on the B-sides most of which were the equal of those on the albums, some arguably superior.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;With the exception of their debut single, Supersonic, none of these had been released in America, hence the idea of compiling the best of the B-sides onto an album for their benefit.ýThe track listing was apparently chosen by fans on the Internet with some influence from Noel Gallagher, and two of his justly favourite compositions, Underneath The Sky and The Masterplan, make it onto the album alongside obvious musts like Acquiesce and Fade Away. All date from 1994 and 1995 apart from two 1997 recordings that appear on singles extracted from Be Here Now.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;The biggest omission is the non-album single Whatever, perhaps excluded on the grounds that it was not a B-side. Step Out (the B-side of Don't Look Back In Anger), removed from Morning Glory for legal reasons due to its similarity to Stevie Wonder's Uptight, misses out again, as does the anthemic Round Are Way, and the Slade cover Cum On Feel The Noize. However, rockers like Headshrinker and the Bacharach-inspired Going Nowhere easily earn their places in the company of the likes of the acoustic ballad Talk Tonight and the more recent (though written in 1990) Going Nowhere.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Completists should note that the live I Am The Walrus, recorded at a soundcheck in Gleneagles, fades at 6.24, whereas on the Cigarettes And Alcohol EP it is complete at 8.14. Listen Up has been shorn of 18 seconds from its guitar solo, and Half A World Away, now known to the nation as the theme of The Royle Family, inexplicably fades out just a couple of seconds short of its natural end as heard on the Whatever EP.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;However, on the strength of these supposedly second division songs, perhaps there are actually three essential Oasis albums

Although this album is better than the absurdly awful "Be Here Now" - it is not as terribly bad and annoying as that album - there are real no standout tracks on this album. "Acquiesce," the first track is decent, but other tracks are average, don't stick out and don't stay in your memory long, or are just bad. I borrowed this CD from the library for 3 weeks and gave it several listens. That is usually enough time for me to judge an album enough for me to know whether it's worth buying, and this one just isn't. [...]
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Oasis must have spent all their creative energy on Definitely Maybe and (What's the Story) Morning Glory because they have not made an album that is even half-decent since then.  I have wasted a lot of time borrowing CD's released since their two breakthrough albums wondering "hmm... what ever happened to Oasis anyway?" to see if they released any decent material since their glory days.  The answer is NO and I do not recommend listening to any albums after their first two.  I did the same thing with Collective Soul's later albums, a group that has continued to release good material even after their glory days in the mid-90s, but not Oasis.  Must be the coke.

Noel Gallagher is in his seemingly most creative stage when it's just him and his acoustic guitar.  Thus many of these great songs were born, from Half the World Away, to Going Nowhere, which he states was created on a train ride well before Oasis was made big.  In this collection you also get a mega-should have been an a-side, Talk Tonight, which was an addition to the U.S. release of Wonderwall.  This song, along with Track 9, Rocking Chair were recorded during a recording session in Texas.  
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Maybe the biggest, and most anthemic song of all, and certainly a crowd favourite at any of their live shows, is track 1, Acquiesce.  From the driving guitar riffs that reek of attitude, to the contrast of Liam singing the verses and Noel taking the chorus vocals.  It is very easy to see why they still favour singing this song live to this date, and even performed it on Saturday Night Live.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;You also have the wanderer ode, Underneath the Sky, and the lively and catchy Fade Away, which was replaced for on DM by Slide Away.  Another must have for any fan is their live recording of I Am The Walrus, which they nail right on.. this is a great tribute to the Beatles, and has an Oasis touch of attitude added in.  
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Closing out this album, is the Title-track of the album, Masterplan.  Noel always considered this his masterpiece, and it's easy to see why.  From the sweeping vocals, to the melodic and haunting orchestra, and the touching finish, this song could quite possibly be Noel's best, and it's hard to imagine that this could have been left as only a b-side.  
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;..all in all, this is easily as good as your Be Here Now, and SOTSOG albums.. a must have, truly.

Oasis makes a notable exception, as mentioned by some other reviewers here, in that their b-sides are just as good, maybe better, than some of their album tracks.  
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;If things had worked out differently, The Masterplan could have been the second half of a double album.  It compliments (What's The Story) Morning Glory and Be Here Now quite nicely.  I sincerely hope there are future b-sides compilations for their latest albums, because tracking down singles and imports can be quite tedious.

                    <Source>Amazon.com</Source><Content>Following a British rock tradition initiated by the Beatles and lovingly inherited by the Jam and the Clash, Oasis is the only band of the CD era to offer fans extra tracks on their singles that are often as good as, if not better than, the hits. Rather than saving his new songs for the next full album, Noel Gallagher prefers immediacy. Thus, this compilation of those various "B-Sides"--many available as nonimports for the first time--works just great as a listening experience, offering metallic rushes ("Acquiesce," "The Swamp Song") and absolute melodic beauty ("Talk Tonight," the marvelous "Rockin' Chair"), while conjuring up the ghosts of Mott the Hoople, T. Rex, the Fab Four, and Slade, although Oasis's "Cum On Feel the Noize" is sadly absent. &lt;i&gt;--Bill Holdship&lt;/i&gt;</Content>

In spots, it's a bit overproduced.  Like all its predecessors, this Oasis album has that air of familiarity and gives you that, "I've heard this before" feeling.  I think it's quite fresh, though.  Oasis is a paradox: they beg, steal and borrow from the Who, the Beatles, the Stones, the Stone Roses, Slade, T. Rex, Bowie, etc, but still come out sounding like Oasis.  With the exception of one or two songs that are blatant rip-offs, the worst that can be said for its originality is that it's "derivative" in places.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;This is also the first Oasis album with songs written by the non-Gallagher members of the band, and the first album to feature more than one song by Liam (three, in fact).  
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;"The Hindu Times" (Noel) - Neo-psychedelic.  Big guitars with raga-sounding lead guitar licks and Liam's braying vocals.  In the rhythm guitar you'll hear a smidgeon of "Jumpin' Jack Flash."    This is a song (apparently) about nothing ("I get so I high I just can't feel it.").  It's one of the better songs on the album and a good one to crank with the windows down.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;"Force of Nature" (Noel) - This song floated around for a year or two before HC as Noel solo song (he's the singer.)  Noel's vocals are great; he really screams it out.  There's a healthy dose of anger and cynicism in this one, rare for Oasis.  The best line: "I betcha knew right away/It's all over town that the sun's going down/on the days of your easy life."  The ghost of Marc Bolan has certainly possessed this tune.  
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;"Hung in a Bad Place" (Gem Archer) - Though not written by a Gallagher, "Hung" sounds like it would have fit right in on Definitely Maybe.  It's another big guitar song with Liam's nasally snarl.  The more I hear it the more I dig it!  Lyrically, it's in the vein of "Free" by Jagger/Richards: "I can go where I wanna/be where I wanna be now . . ."   This has the makings of a great live tune.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;"Stop Crying Your Heart Out" (Noel) - When I hear this song all I can think of is "Dear Friend" off of Wings' Wild Life.  After the slowly plodding piano intro, it turns into a power ballad.  The lyrics are weak and cliche.  Sample: "`Cuz all of the stars are fading away/just try not to worry/you'll see them someday . . ."  This is one of the more disappointing songs on the album and, unfortunately, it ended up being a single. 
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;"Songbird" (Liam) - Liam, with typical braggadocio, declared this one, "Better than anything on Revolver."  The only Beatles song this tune might be better than is "Mister Moonlight" or "Revolution # 9," and even that would be a stretch.  The guitar and rhythm sound like they're taken directly from "Lyin' Eyes" by the Eagles.  It's a throw away and shouldn't be on the album.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;"Little by Little" (Noel) - Noel sings this one and does a great job on vocals.  The verses sound like many a Pink Floyd tune.  The chorus makes this a good pop-rock tune.  It has a nice guitar solo.  It's basically about a relationship and inner searching ("Why am I really here?") There's nothing new in it, musically or lyrically, but it's a pretty good track, nonetheless.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;"A Quick Peep" (Andy Bell) - Instrumental.  I can't decide whether this is Pink Floyd doing The Pogues or The Pogues doing Pink Floyd.  Either way, it should have been saved for an EP or a B-side.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;"(Probably) All in the Mind" (Noel) -  Perhaps a bit of a twist on the whole neo-psychedelic thing.  Instead of dealing with personal exploration, it's about wanting to run away with someone else to another "life" that may only exist in his imagination.  Not bad. 
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;"She is Love" (Noel) - Has a folk-rock-pseudo-soul feel.  Definitely pot-laced.  I think the Black Crowes rubbed off on Noel when they toured together last year.  It's Oasis doing a stripped-down version of "Soul Singing" on Lions.  Very catchy.  
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;"Born on a Different Cloud" (Liam) - A blatant Lennon rip off, this song is drenched in "I'm Losing You"from Double Fantasy.  I swear Noel dug up George Harrison up and got him to replay the guitar solo from "How Do You Sleep?"  The lyrics are even more of an obvious theft, ala "living on borrowed time" and "It's no surprise to me/that you're classless, clever and free."  Yoko should sue have sued Liam for this one.  There's a kind of clever . . . er . . . interesting line: "Talking to myself again/this time I think I'm getting through."  If you like covers of John Lennon's solo work, you'll love this one.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;"Better Man" (Liam) - The younger Gallagher takes his turn with a slightly Crowes-esque blues based rocker.  Don't get me wrong, it's not a rip off.  Very good song, certainly Liam's best.  Positive lyrics from Liam who, by all accounts, is a drunken lout.  Very, very subtly, it ends like "Nineteen Hundred Eighty Five" by Paul McCartney/Wings, which probably is no accident.  This track is something like 38 minutes long.  I thought something was wrong with my CD or the player because there was almost a ? hour of silence.  Fast forward to minute 33 and there's a nice little surprise.  
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Heathen Chemistry falls squarely in the middle of the pack of Oasis albums.  It's better than some but worse than others.  It is a nice transition album between Standing on the Shoulders of Giants and Don't Believe the Truth.  3.5 stars would be a more than fair rating for it, but I'm rounding up rather than down, and giving it 4 stars.

Noel Gallaghar (singer/songwriter/lead guitarist)said in a interview around the time of this release that the band should take responsibilty for their own records, its actually very dissapointing even compared to "Standing on the Shoulder of Giants" and "Be Here Now" both which got more flak than they deserved because they were by no means bad albums at all, they were just unfoccussed.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Heathen Chemistry is pretty watered down and weak, it does not stand up well as a entire listen and too much of the tracks sound more filler than anyhting else. 
                        &lt;br /&gt;"The Hindu Times" "Stop Crying Your Heart Out" "Little By Little" would make you think that Oasis are back with a vengeance, to re claim their status, but they just don't cut it with their best songs, and in their own way lack alot of life.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Whats worse is that "Don't Beleive the Truth" is even worse, much worse, and unfortunatly saw Oasis previewing their entire album, miming to the album on TV, just before its release.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;If Oasis want to pull out a stunner they need to get out the electric guitars, crank up the amps and get Owen Morris who produced their first three albums to make them sound "live" and "loud again." Oasis are a live band, thats the sound thats missing from this album.
                        &lt;br /&gt;

People who have read my other reviews know I am a big Oasis fan.  No other rock band of the past 15 years has put out such a huge volume of high quality music.  Oasis' first two albums are straight up classics.  I also think "Be Here Now" is one of the most underrated albums of the 90's and will be recognized as a classic in time.  Oasis' newest, "Don't Believe the Truth," is great as well-- as good as anything they've ever done.  I am sure they have a lot more in them as well.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;That said, "Heathen Chemistry" is a really weak performance.  It's slightly better than "Standing on the Shoulders of Giants," but that's not saying much.  In all, there are really only three decent songs here-- "The Hindu Times," "Hung In a Bad Place," and "Better Man."
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;The production sucks too.  The production on "Be Here Now" was big and loud, but so were the songs.  The songs on "Heathen Chemistry" just can't stand up to all of this clutter.  Noel was smart to hand over the production reigns to someone else for "Don't Believe the Truth."
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Like "Standing on the Shoulders of Giants," "Heathen Chemistry" is an album that only hardcore fans will want.  Still, the fact that Oasis put out two crappy albums doesn't mean they're not a great band.  Out of their 7 major releases, 5 have been great.  Look at how many awful albums the Stones and Bob Dylan have put out

                    <Source>Amazon.com</Source><Content>At their career zenith, Oasis were lauded as the best band in the world. They were actually never the greatest rock &amp; roll band at any time, but for a few years they were the biggest. While they offered the '90s two of its most defining albums, and a resurgence of '60s-influenced Manchester rock, Oasis tumbled off the top of the mountain in the last half of the decade. &lt;I&gt;Heathen Chemistry&lt;/I&gt; is their first step back up the ascent, albeit a small step. The album opens with "The Hindu Times," which will certainly be listed among Oasis's best anthems, and it closes with "Better Man," a distorted-guitar-driven thrill that revs up to 60 mph in second gear. But between the strongest songs on the disc, Noel "Walrus" and Liam "Eggman" Gallagher exploit the Beatles references almost to the breaking point. It's no secret that the Gallaghers worship the Beatles (who doesn't?), but here they've gone beyond obvious influences and stepped right into infringement territory. On "Born on a Different Cloud," Noel's guitar weeps a little too gently, and Liam's signature rasp now sounds like a deliberate imitation of Lennon with a cold. Further, Liam shares the mic with Noel, who sings lead on several tracks, the best being "Force of Nature." Unlike on Beatles albums, however, the switch back and forth is jarring (Liam might be the biggest troublemaker, but he is also the better singer). Nonetheless, if a band is going to unapologetically rip off what was unquestionably the best band in the world, no one does it better than Oasis. &lt;I&gt;--Beth Massa&lt;/I&gt;</Content>

Easily the most bashed work in the Manchester great's back catalogue, called worst album of 2000 on several occasions, slated as a worthless Pink Floyd rip-off with no standout tracks, Standing on the Shoulder represents a career low point for Oasis--this was the first true testament that the band was not immortal, not the Beatles of the new age, but in fact slipping from the title of Brit-Rockers-in-chief.  Sigh. It's the album that die-hard Radiohead and Coldplay fans always refer to when discussing Oasis' inferiority, blasting Noel Gallagher for "never progressing as a song writer."  Sigh again.  I've never really figured out the thunderous disapproval of the album, and I ultimately enjoyed most of the songs.  Does SOTSOG contain some garbage?  Without a doubt, but not nearly enough to ruin the entire experience, or throw Oasis off their high horse as most critics claim.  Here're some facts all listeners need to be aware of:  1) `F****n' in the Bushes,' `Go Let It Out,' and Gas Panic!' are three of the best songs of Oasis' career.  Wasn't `Go Let It Out' #1 hit in the UK, going right alongside `Yellow' and even surpassing `Optimistic'?  2) The biggest problem with SOTSOG occurs in the format, unusual for a psychedelic album such as this.  If there's any real unending quandary here, it's that the worst two songs on the album, `Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is' and `Little James' fall in at numbers 4 and 5 respectively.  These should have been either left out or positioned differently, perhaps further down in the line up while moving high qualities, perhaps `Roll It Over,' up in the track listing. 3) The album is without a doubt a step up from Be Here Now, which contains about five fillers/B-sides whereas SOTSOG has no more than two.  4)  Giants is Easy Listening.  Oasis flirts with the Easy Listening genre on several junctures, most notably with `Wonderwall' and `Cast No Shadow', but usually sticks to anthemic Indie and at sometimes Hard Rock.  I believe that this album has been rejected as quality Oasis by many fans due to the lack of guitars and the overwhelming presence of synthesizers.  It doesn't always work--` Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is' for example--but it's definitely different.  Not only should it be respected and appreciated by fans, but it should be praised for its boldness.  5)  Although inaccessible at times, SOTSOG flows unlike any other Oasis album.  In this way, it tops both Definitely Maybe and Morning Glory?--a daring yet factual assessment.  
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;If nothing else, the album's worth it for `F****n' in the Bushes,' `Go Let It Out,' and Gas Panic!'.  But underneath the surface, it's much more than just a singles album like the predecessor Be Here Now;  it's a flowing, intelligent collection of songs that have been tarnished by the attitude of dismissive fans.

While both are very good, I'd have to say that this one is the album I'd have to go with for my personal favorite. Don't Believe The Truth is tied with this one for me. 
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;There's just something here that it seems like Oasis have always been trying to block up with pure attitude and drug-fueled anthems. This is the sober, matured Oasis who are left in the aftermath of their dreams come true, to be rock'n'roll stars, standing on the shoulders of the lives they created, with nowhere to go but down. 
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Although the band was off drinking and drugs while making this album, ironically it is their most psychedelic and foggy effort. There are some of Oasis's weakest tracks on this one "Put Yer Money Where Yer Mouth Is", and "I Can See A Liar", but there are also some of Oasis's best like "Roll It Over". 
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Though this is by no means their strongest album, it is by far their most honest, and instrospective work to date. It's the sound of the Gallaghers turning away from rough attitude, and facing life head-on.

It took years before I was ready to take another chance w/ Oasis, and after listening to album tracks on line, I chose this album.  I further minimized the risk of adding a stinker to my collection by buying used.  Well what a shock.  "Shoulders..." is actually damn good.  It's got a very consistent sound-- sort of a heavy pop with big beat rhythm.  Good songwriting, good sound effects and production, and great vocal melodies.  Now I "get" Oasis.  I always liked "WTSMG" but now I have respect for them and feel like I understand what keeps them going.  I think classic rock stations in the US should be ashamed for not adding Oasis to their limited pantheon of artists.</Content>

'...Giants' may frustrate those who want the band to re-write 'Definitely Maybe' for the rest of their lives but this album has some killer moments and powerful songs. 'Gas Panic' has a brilliant melody and is a stunning dark night of the soul epic which you rarely get from the Gallagher brothers. 'Who Feels Love' and 'Sunday Morning Call' were beautiful if flop singles in comparison to the catchy 'Go Let It Out'. The album suffers lyrically in places but so do the majority of Oasis albums! No 'Morning Glory' but far from a disaster.     </Content>

You may or may not like them, or like their style at the beginning but not later phases, and vice-versa. But this album is completely different than every other Oasis album. It has a completely different sound (I'm not saying it's bad - not my taste to be honest - but some people might like it). If you're looking for "Oasis Sound" albuns, you're looking in the wrong place. The sound here is noisy, you can see it was not worked on.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, Oasis felt too big for their own good, and thought people would like and buy anything they did - so "why bother with the lyrics, clear sound and instrumentality that got us here?" Well, at least it's the feeling I got.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;I'm a huge Oasis fan from day 1. My true, honest opinion is: you can buy absolutely ANY of their other albums and get GREAT Oasis music. In this album, you'll find something else, a sound that's not theirs. I have it, and would trade it for any of the two I don't yet have, Heathen Chemistry and Don't Believe the Truth. Totally dispensible from an Oasis collection. Bad music? Well, we each have our own tastes, so who am I to judge? If you're curious, listen to it and judge yourself! ;) But in Oasis' on words: "We'll never release s*** again!"

                    <Source>Amazon.com</Source><Content>With &lt;i&gt;Standing on the Shoulder of Giants&lt;/i&gt;, the self-professed "biggest rock &amp; roll band in the world" continue their exploration of great British rock of the late '60s. Paying homage to heroes is one thing, but many of &lt;i&gt;Standing&lt;/i&gt;'s best moments sound like their icons' low points. This is Oasis, however, and they do pull some stunners out of their hats. "Gas Panic" and "Where Did It All Go Wrong?" demonstrate the command of catchy hooks and epic anthems that powered their classic first two albums, &lt;i&gt;Definitely Maybe&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;(What's the Story) Morning Glory?&lt;/i&gt; Elsewhere, their influences are more obvious. The psychedelic "Who Feels Love?" is George Harrison in full Eastern mystic mode, complete with sitar, tabla, and tape loops. The rocker "Put Yer Money Where Yer Mouth Is" has the strut and stomp of vintage Doors and Rolling Stones, but is ultimately let down by weak wordplay. Liam Gallagher's "Little James," a paean to paternal love, also contains some laughable couplets ("You live for your toys, even though they make noise"). Still, &lt;i&gt;Standing&lt;/i&gt; is a definite improvement over its 1997 predecessor, &lt;i&gt;Be Here Now&lt;/i&gt;. For real proof that Oasis resurrected Britpop in the '90s, newcomers would do well to investigate &lt;i&gt;Definitely Maybe&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;(What's the Story) Morning Glory?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;--Rob Burrow&lt;/i&gt; </Content>

                    <Source>Amazon.com</Source><Content>The first annual Oasis Smooth Jazz Awards ceremony was held in January 2000 in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area, home of the Oasis smooth-jazz radio station. This 14-song compilation showcases previously released tracks that are representative of the artists who performed at the show--folks like Dave Koz and Russ Freeman &amp; the Rippingtons. This collection also boasts up-and-coming acts with brand new music not yet heard on radio. The best of the latter class includes a Stanley Clarke-sounding bassist, Brian Bromberg, doing a highly charged duet with smooth jazz superstar Richard Elliot. Newcomer Grady Nichols may have the best instrumental track on the sampler with "Alone with You," which was co-written and produced by Jeff Lorber.&lt;p&gt;   The producers here did a pretty good job of creating the flavor of smooth-jazz radio, but the choice of Jonathan Butler and Patti Austin as the only vocalists was outstanding. Of course, the chosen songs--Butler's take on the Jr. Walker &amp; the All Stars classic "What Does It Take" and Austin's title track from her album &lt;I&gt;In and Out of Love&lt;/I&gt;--contain a lot more urban spirit than most smooth radio stations are willing to air.  &lt;I&gt;--Mark Ruffin&lt;/I&gt;</Content>

I feel so sorry for any Oasis fan who hasn't heard this song, as well as a number of their other b-sides; whether it's because they weren't featured on The Masterplan or because they're from more recent singles released after The Masterplan (e.g. Go Let It Out, All Around The World). It's almost funny to think that Oasis is at their best where and when nobody's looking. There's no question "Whatever" is an all-time top 10 (or at least top 15) Oasis track.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;As unbelievably great as "Whatever" truly is, I have to say that "Half The World Away" is the best song on this single. But because it was featured on The Masterplan, it doesn't add much to this single. "(It's Good) To Be Free" isn't that great a song, and there's enough freeness in the 6-minute title track to go around, anyway. And, for whatever reason, "Slide Away" (an a-side from Oasis' debut, Definitely Maybe) is featured as the final track. I'm not really sure why it's here. It doesn't take away from this single's greatness, but it doesn't add to it either.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;This is undoubtedly the best Oasis single ever released. The only other single that even comes close in comparison is "Go Let It Out" (because the two b-sides there are better than the entire album--Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants), although none of the songs featured there can shake a stick or a twig or a branch at "Whatever" and its lasting brilliance. And because it was left off The Masterplan, "Whatever" has become an essential single that every Oasis fan out there should own. Don't miss out on this timeless tune.

If I would of heard this as soon as it came out I would of known from that point that Oasis was indeed the biggest band of the moment. Unfortunatley I had to hear it couple years later and until now I had to own this top single.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Amazing music and I know it will continue to shine on for decades and decades. Prolly now it's not considered a classic altho it has to be but in the future I do know it will be between the bestes singles of all times. 
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;This will be worth so much much more than what its now.

Even though its 10 years old its still one of the best singles released in that period. The B-sides are as good as A-sides which can be found on the masterplan. Also has the non-album-single "slide-away" on the 4th track. You could as well say its a Double A-Side single.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anybody!

The heat was on, the expectations were high, and the thousands of fans that crammed the famous soccor field were "mad for it!" Everything was going good; Oasis were and still are the biggest band in England with a timeless influence on most of the bands coming out of America and Europe today, and they were to take the stage by storm, but there was one too many problems: Liam had just broken up with his then wife actress Patsi Kensit, was seriously drunk, and Noel wasn't talking to him. The effects of all of the above are evident on this recording.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Liam greets the fans as soon as he steps onstage after the intro of F**kin' In The Bushes fades out with a hammering comment at Wembley Stadium, calling it a 'sh*thole', before sarcastically and hilariously saying "Hello, Manchester!" which is welcomed with a few boos from the crowd and a giggle from Noel. After that, the music plays on with a collection of their most recent singles from their 2000 album Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants: the handraiser Go Let It Out and the soothing Who Feels Love, before venturing into a string of greatest hits, in no order: Wonderwall, Don't Look Back In Anger, Live Forever, Stand By Me, Roll With It, Champagne Supernova, and Supersonic. In between songs, Liam and Noel are heard commenting with and at the crowd ("This is for all the people in the front row..." as Liam presents a song), the lighting operator ("...turn the f**kin' light off!" as Noel scorns the poor fellow), and each other ("Let's have a couple more of these songs, Noel...write a couple more of these babies!" as Liam presents Supersonic). The highlights on Familiar To Millions are the cover versions of The Beatles' Helter Skelter (taken from the US tour), and Neil Young's Hey Hey My My (which Noel sings with a passion), and the B-side Step Out (which is an underrated Noel sung number).
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Familiar To Millions may not be the best live album ever released; in my opinion, it is not (Liam's tired voice is enough to convince me). But the Gallagher brothers manage to make it unintentionally entertaining and funny at times.

This was an opportunity to perform a memorable, energetic and musical show, well it was certainly memorable.
                        &lt;br /&gt;The whole thing with getting the crowd singing along and adding in guitar solos that just seem to go on froever isnt what oasis are capable of, and to put it on an album...
                        &lt;br /&gt;I also cannot believe the songs they put on there, or didnt put on. There are tracks such as "Gas Panic!" and "Who feels love?" whos ever heard of this crap more like. "Supersonic" "Stand by me" and "Live Forever" are probably the only songs worthy of being on there, seeing as Champagne Supernova and Cigarettes and Alcohol are delivered so poorly.
                        &lt;br /&gt;This album is missing many of the bands greatest and underrated songs, such as, "Morning Glory" and "Rock and Roll star", instead they insist on playing them boring, repetitive songs that everyone associates with oasis because they're too thick to notice the decent tracks, how many times have we heard "Dont look back in anger" and "Wonderwall" (which incidentally arent done by oasis on this album, but half of the drunken crowd) far too many times, so you dont have to put them on an album.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Dont waste your money.

They rush their way through "Wonderwall" like they're bored with it,  and their version of Champagne Supernova also sounds weak voiced. Now some times the ragged effect does work, versions of "Stand by Me", "Live Forever" and "Cigarettes and Alcohol" are still pretty rousing. 
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Liam is still up to his onstage shenanigans, asking the girls in the audience to show some breasts, leading the crowd in chanting his name, pointing out to Noel that he finally got all the words to "Roll With It" right in mid-song, giving the people in the front row a hard time, complaining about the lighting and stage props, and even giving Noel yet another hard time, "you should write more songs like this Noel." Implying that he hasn't been writing songs like that lately. But he makes a conciliatory gesture, to Noel at least later when he praises the lyrics for "Gas Panic". 
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;They're still a very fun band live and a tight band musicianship-wise at least anyway.  Now if they could just get Liam to behave himself... ah screw that, then they wouldn't be so much fun.  Just stick to the alcohol, Liam, and leave the cigarettes alone.

Don't Look Back in Anger is, if possible, even better than the studio version; the band goes insane on Supersonic and Shakermaker; only Champagne Supernova seems to lose some of its eerie grace with the more rough-around-the-edges live sound. Of course, Liam acts out a bit: it's hard to catch what he's saying most of the time, but it's quite amusing when you do.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;"This is for all the people in the front row...no not you...nor you guys...alright, maybe you. And you."
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Even songs that were less than classic in the studio, like Roll With It, get a boost from the live energy - on that particular number, Liam now advises us not to let "any f*****" get in our way.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;And while the band is great, the audience is impressive in their own right:
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;-There's a moment during the first verse of Wonderwall when they suddenly sounds like the world's biggest gospel choir.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;-Such is Liam's faith in them that he even lets them take the whole chorus of Don't Look Back in Anger - and even though it comes through a bit muted, it's pretty incredible.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Finally, Liam's weary take on Stand By Me, supported by the always-enthusiastic audience, has to rank among the most affecting pieces of music ever recorded. It's just so - _romantic_.

                        &lt;br /&gt;Its a very loud and rocky performance, and theres no acoustic guitars used, even wonderwall is done on an electric.
                        &lt;br /&gt;Theres also some great covers of Neil youngs "hey hey mymy " by Noel gallygally and "Helter Skelter"
                        &lt;br /&gt;Laims voice is quite rough and raspy which adds a nice "real" and "rock n roll" sound to all the songs.

                <EditorialReview>
                    <Source>Amazon.com</Source><Content>In 2000 Oasis wisely dispensed with theatrics and concentrated on being the world's greatest stadium-sized pub-rock band. And so, with just three mammoth video walls in tow, they toured the world. Big as the video screens were, however, the band's straight-ahead rock and Liam Gallagher's mouth were even bigger, and contributed much to the drama, tension, and entertainment of the tour behind &lt;I&gt;Standing on the Shoulder of Giants&lt;/I&gt;. Fine examples of both were recorded when they played Wembley Stadium. Musically, Oasis make good on their claims to be the biggest and the best with rocking versions of "Supersonic," "Shakermaker," "Cigarettes &amp; Alcohol," and "Live Forever." As for Liam, &lt;I&gt;Familiar to Millions&lt;/I&gt; wouldn't be half the album it is had his inane ramblings, brotherly abuse, and audience taunts been edited out. That's where the real live atmosphere lies--there and in the sound of 70,000 fans singing the choruses of "Wonderwall" and "Don't Look Back in Anger." &lt;I&gt;--Dan Gennoe&lt;/I&gt; </Content>
